h2. Mogade For .NET

Mogade is a free service web-based service which allows game developers to quickly enchance their games with auxiliary functionality (such as leaderboards).

This is the official .NET library - which is meant not only to be used within games, but also to serve as the basis for platform specific implementations. Developers interested in building a library for their own language will hopefully find this library to be decent documentation of the mogade API.

h3. API Overview

Mogade is based around a _RESTish_ API, accepting and returning JSON messages.  All message into the mogade service require at least 3 parameters:

* v - the api version (currently set to 1)
* key - the game key (which developers get when they create a game at "http://mogade.com":http://mogade.com)
* sig - an md5 signature of the parameters including the game's secret key (also received from the website)

A request to save a score might look something like:
<pre>PUT http://api.mogade.com/api/scores
{
   key: '4cc3cb835346ed081f00003e',
   v: 1,
   sig: '97773672963b1f4c6160f31afd25da97',
   leaderboard_id:'4cc425bf5346ed081f0000ee',
   score:
   {     
     username: 'goku',
     points: 9001     
   }
}</pre>

In this case, the response might yield something along the lines of:
<pre>{ daily: 10; weekly: 239: overall: 3044}</pre>

Which are the daily, weekly and overall ranks for a score of 9001 for the specified leaderboard
